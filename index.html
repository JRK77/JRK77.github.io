                <p>I'm an aspiring software developer and I have an upcoming assessment day with your organisation, Roke Manor Research.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've created this site so that you can start to get to know me before the assessment day!</p>

                <h2>Why do I want to be part of the team at Roke?</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Having briefly taught maths in a high school and spent several years working in accounting, I'm working my socks off to achieve a career change to software development!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I particularly want to join your team at Roke Manor for 4 main reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This role is an amazing opening to join a team that cultivates innovation, unorthodox thinking, and creativity.</li>
                    <li>A fantastic opportunity to learn on the job while working towards a level 6 apprenticeship and a degree.</li>
                    <li>Roke Manor is a highly rated employer: 4.3 stars on Glassdoor and good reviews on Indeed!</li>
                    <li>A place where my work will make a meaningful difference to a greater cause: defence and national security.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>I am seeking a position in a challenging environment that will drive personal growth, both academically and personally. I don't 'just' want a 9-5 job, I want a role within an organisation that will inspire and enable me to produce my life's greatest work! I believe that Roke offers this kind of environment and thus, I feel that my personality and commitment to learning and personal development matches the culture at Roke.</p>

                <h2>What do I bring to the table?</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>From day 1, I can offer the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Maturity</span>. I'm not fresh out of college, so I have the maturity and people skills that years of work experience brings.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Ability to manage my own learning</span>. Having studied maths at university level, not to mention having taught maths to others, the academic aspect of the apprenticeship is well within my capability.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Initiative and persistence</span>. I'm self-teaching coding and I have a genuine drive to become a professional software developer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I have years of experience meeting with clients face to face and I am able to represent the team at Roke in a professional manner, while exercising discretion and confidentiality.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I embrace teamwork with a positive mindset - I believe that no major achievement in history has ever been made without the input of a team of people. I also value inclusion and diversity as I believe that teams are strengthened by welcoming the perspectives and insight offered by people from diverse backgrounds and with a range of experiences.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition, I am teaching myself to code on Codecademy. I have completed the Intermediate Python 3 course and I am currently working on the Data Scientist and Full-Stack Engineer career paths. I anticipate completing both paths prior to the start of the Roke apprenticeship, and in so doing I will have learned about the following:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express JS,  Python, SQL, PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Version control on GitHub, React, Redux, Jupyter Notebooks</li>
                    <li>API development with Swagger and OpenAPI</li>
                    <li>DevOps</li>
                    <li>Data manipulation with Pandas</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis testing</li>
                    <li>Data visualisation with Matplotlib and Seaborn</li>
                    <li>Natural language processing</li>
                    <li>Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning</li>
                </ul>
                <p> In my coding studies, I have collaborated on projects with other learners. I have studied maths at university level and I have a logical and inquisitive mindset.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If I am fortunate enough to be given this amazing opportunity, I have the ambition to want to undertake further study following completion of the BSc. I would certainly like to undertake an MSc, and would jump at the opportunity to eventually publish original research by completing a PhD.</p>

                <p>I am a qualified glider pilot and I have flown solo on 8 different aircraft types. I have also flown in 3 types of powered aircraft while receiving instruction on navigation. I have flown in all forms of lift: thermal, ridge, and wave.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As you might imagine, flying solo quickly builds character! Transferable skills include the ability to make decisions (quickly!), multi-tasking, and seeing the big picture while working with the details.</p>

                <p>I am a keen scuba diver, possessing the rescue diver qualification along with the nitrox speciality which allows me to blend different percentages of oxygen. As part of my rescue diver certification, I qualified as an emergency first responder and have been trained to use an automated external defibrilator.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I derive great pleasure from taking long walks in the countryside - getting out in the fresh air is good for the soul.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy spending time with friends by going for meals, visiting the cinema, or having a social drink.</p>
